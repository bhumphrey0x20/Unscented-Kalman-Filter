# Unscented Kalman Filter Project 
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

This project utilized an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

This project uses the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF

## Source Files

Source files for the project are located in /src. Required coding for the development of the UKF was done primarily in ukf.cpp, ukf.h, tools.cpp, and tools.h. Additionally, main.cpp was modified from the original repository to test and debug the filter, using just lidar or radar measurement data, and to write Normalized Innovation Squared (NIS) data to build/NIS.dat.


## Other Important Dependencies
* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

* The following additional dependencies were used:
	* Python 3.5.2
  * Numpy 1.12.1


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF` Previous versions use i/o from text files.  The current state uses i/o
from the simulator.

## Plotting NIS data in Python
1. In src/ukf.cpp change `write_nis = false` to `write_nis = true`, on line 72, to print nis values to build/NIS.dat
2. Run filter through simulator.
3. In build folder, Run `python plotnis.py`


## Project results

The project ran the Unscented Kalman Filter using both Lidar and Radar data, with RMSE values = [0.0672, 0.0957, 0.2783, 0.2128]. 


A plot of the NIS values is shown below.
